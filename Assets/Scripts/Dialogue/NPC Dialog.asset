    - Hello traveller, I see you've been collecting these orbs that are scattered
      all over the place, cluttering this town. May I ask you to continue picking
      these up? It's not a good look...
    - Wonderful!! If you collect all of them there would be a reward. There should
      be around 100 or so. So I suggest you start cleaning up as soon as you can.
